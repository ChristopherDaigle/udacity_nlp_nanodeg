    "\n",
    "One feature of our communication type is a lack of a precisely defined structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does that make things difficult: there is ambiguity in the relationship of each item in human communcation that there is not in mathematics or computer programming\n",
    "> * Math and programming are designed to be as unambiguous as possible and are suited for computers to process\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured languages are easy to parse and understand for computers, because they are defined by a strict set of rules, or **grammar**. When a statement doesn't match the implied grammar, **the computer doesn't try to guess the meaning**. Humans do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can process words and phrases to understand: **keywords, parts of speech (POS), named entities (NER), dates, and quantities**. Using this information, computers can then make sense of: **statements, questions, or instructions**. With this, the computer can take that information to analyze documents and: **identify frequent and rare words, identify tone and sentiment, or cluster similar documents together**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context is also important. Consider the sentence:\n",
    "> The sofa didn't fit through the door because it was too narrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sentence, it is unclear what \"it\" refers too being too narrow. \"It\" could refer to either the sofa or the door. Humans know that wide things don't fit through narrow things, so it is the door which is too narrow, but this is ambiguous. So, the computer, unless it **understands the relationship of wide and narrow and fitting through something**, would be unable to disambiguate the sentence above!"

    "Goal: Take raw input text, clean it, normalize it, and convert it into a form that is suitable for feature extraction\n",

    "Goal: extract and produce feature representations that are appropriate for the type of model you are planning to use\n",

    "Why can we not feed text in directly? Think about where we get text to begin with.\n",

    "Consider a web page, it is rendered on the left from the information on the right. We would not want to process the HTML tags.\n",

    "<img src=\"img_2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Some knowledge of the source medium can help you properly handle the input. In the end, **your goal is to extract plain text that is free of any source specific markers or constructs that are not relevant to your task**. Once you have the cleaned text, further processing may be required. For example, capitalization doesn't usually change the meaning of the word, but capitilization does alter the word's interpretation to the computer. So, the word may need to be lowercased so that all words are treated the same.\n",
