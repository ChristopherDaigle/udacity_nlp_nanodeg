    "# Part of Speech (POS) Tagging with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we introduce **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**, which are used to model sequences (including time-series data).\n",
    "\n",
    "**HMMs** have been successfully used on both supervised and unsupervised problems with sequence data in applications like speech recognition, bioinformatics, sign language recognition, and gesture recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is closely related to the project at the end of this course, where you will use a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** to tag parts of speech in English sentences. This is a common pre-processing task in natural language processing."

    "## Using a LookUp Table to Assign POS - Rudimentary Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have two sentences for training data:\n",
    "1. \"Mary saw Jane\" -> {\"Mary: \"noun\", \"saw\": \"verb\", \"Jane\": \"noun\"}\n",
    "2. \"Jane saw Will\" -> {\"Jane: \"noun\", \"saw\": \"verb\", \"Will\": \"noun\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can create a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Noun | Verb|\n",
    "|:-|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "|Mary|1|0|\n",
    "|saw|0|2|\n",
    "|Jane|2|0|\n",
    "|Will|1|0|\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, if we have a sentence \"Mary saw Will\", we can use the lookup table and note:\n",
    "* Mary is a noun 100% of the time (in training data)\n",
    "* Saw is a verb 100% of the time (in training data)\n",
    "* Will is a noun 100% of the time (in training data)\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src='img_42.png' width=700 align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, that worked! However, we can't reasonably expect the LookUp Table method to work all, or maybe most, of the time\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a more complex sentence series now as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have three sentences for training data:\n",
    "1. \"Mary will see Jane\" -> {\"Mary\": \"noun\", \"will\": \"modal\", \"see\": \"verb\", \"Jane\": \"noun\"}\n",
    "2. \"Will will see Mary\" -> {\"Will\": \"noun\", \"will\": \"modal\", \"see\": \"verb\", \"Mary\": \"noun\"}\n",
    "3. \"Jane will see Will\" -> {\"Jane\": \"noun\", \"will\": \"modal\", \"see\": \"verb\", \"Will\": \"noun\"}\n",

    "|see|0|3|0|\n",
    "|Jane|2|0|0|\n",
    "|Will|2|0|3|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets take a new sentence, \"Mary will see Will\", and tag it based on the LookUp Table:\n",
    "* Mary is a noun 100% of the time -> Mary: noun\n",
    "* will is a modal $\\frac{3}{5}$ and a noun $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the time -> will: modal\n",
    "* see is a verb 100% of the time-> see:verb\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can tag this sentence as such:\n",
    "* \"Mary will see Will\" -> {\"Mary: \"noun\", \"see\": \"verb\", \"will\": \"modal\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a problem, because we know Will is a noun and not a modal! This LookUp Table works by assigning the most prevalent POS Tag and isn't aware of context!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bi-Gram LookUp Table\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can the LookUp table take advantage of context? We can assign frequencies instead to groups of words, namely n-grams!\n",

    "|see-will|0|0|1|\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, lets take the same sentence as before, \"Mary will see Will\", and tag it based on the bi-gram LookUp Table:\n",
    "* mary will is a noun-modal 100% of the time -> Mary: noun, will: modal\n",
    "* will see is a modal-verb 100% of the time -> will: modal, see: verb\n",
    "* see will is a verb-noun 100% of the time -> see: verb, will: noun\n",
