    "# Introduction to Computing With Natural Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the course on Computing with natural language. In the course, you will learn advanced techniques like word embeddings, deep learning attention, and more. By the end, you will build a machine translation model using recurrent neural network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 1: Feature extraction and embedding\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to use Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVE to extract features that you can use in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 2: Topic modeling\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn to split a collection of documents into topics using Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA). In the lab, you'll be able to apply this model to a dataset of news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 3: Sentiment analysis\n",
    "You will learn about using several machine learning classifiers, including Recurrent Neural Networks, to predict the sentiment in text. Apply this to a dataset of movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 4: Sequence to sequence\n",
    "Here you'll learn about a specific architecture of RNNs for generating one sequence from another sequence. These RNNs are useful for chatbots, machine translation, and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 5: Deep learning attention\n",
    "Attention is one of the most important recent innovations in deep learning. In this section, you'll learn attention, and you'll go over a basic implementation of it in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 6: RNN Keras lab\n",
    "This section will prepare you for the Machine Translation project. Here you will get hands-on practice with RNNs in Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final project: Machine translation\n",
    "In this project, you will apply the skills you've learned in Natural Language Processing to the challenging and extremely rewarding task of Machine Translation."

    "## Course Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "To have a pleasant journey in this course, it's recommended to have the following prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intermediate to advanced Python experience. You are familiar with object-oriented programming. You can write nested for loops and can read and understand code written by others.\n",
    "* Intermediate linear algebra background. You are familiar with vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, dot product, and factorial.\n",
    "* Intermediate statistics background. You are familiar with probability, conditional probability, binomial distribution, and multinomial distribution.\n",
    "* Intermediate knowledge of machine learning techniques. You can describe a machine learning training process. You can describe backpropagation and have seen a few examples of neural network architecture (preferrable a recurrent neural network or a long short-term memory network).\n",
    "* Basic to deep learning framework experience. You have seen or worked with TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch before.\n",
    "* Basic NLP and text processing knowledge. You understand techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and, lemmatization."
